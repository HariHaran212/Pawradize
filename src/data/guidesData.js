      <p class="text-lg">Welcome to the exciting journey of pet parenthood! Bringing a new puppy home is a joyful experience, but it also comes with responsibility. A little preparation can make the transition smooth for both you and your new furry family member. This guide will walk you through the essentials.</p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-text-dark mt-8 mb-4">1. Preparing Your Home</h2>
      <p>Before your puppy arrives, you need to create a safe and comfortable environment. "Puppy-proofing" is similar to baby-proofing. Get down on their level to spot potential hazards.</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Secure Cords:</strong> Tuck away or cover all electrical cords.</li>
        <li><strong>Remove Toxins:</strong> Move houseplants, cleaning supplies, and chemicals out of reach.</li>
        <li><strong>Create a Safe Space:</strong> Set up a crate or a designated bed in a quiet area.</li>
        <li><strong>Get the Essentials:</strong> Have food/water bowls, a collar with an ID tag, and toys ready.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-text-dark mt-8 mb-4">2. The First 24 Hours</h2>
      <p>The first day is all about making your puppy feel secure. Introduce them to the house calmly. Show them where their food, water, and bed are. Begin establishing a routine for potty breaks immediatelyâ€”take them out every 1-2 hours.</p>

      <p class="text-lg">Bringing a tiny, purring kitten into your life is a magical experience. Unlike puppies, kittens often thrive with a slow and gentle introduction to their new world. With a little planning, you can ensure your new companion feels safe and ready to become a loving member of your family.</p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-text-dark mt-8 mb-4">1. Create a "Safe Room"</h2>
      <p>For the first few days, confine your kitten to a single, quiet room to help them acclimate. Equip it with everything they need: a litter box, food/water, a cozy bed, and a scratching post.</p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-text-dark mt-8 mb-4">2. The First Few Days: Patience is Key</h2>
      <p>When you first bring your kitten home, place their carrier in the safe room and open the door. Let them come out on their own time. Sit quietly in the room to keep them company, but don't force interaction. Let their curiosity guide them.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-text-dark mt-8 mb-4">1. Common Signs of Anxiety</h2>
      <p>Keep an eye out for these common stress signals:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
        <li><strong>In Dogs:</strong> Excessive barking, pacing, destructive behavior, or panting.</li>
        <li><strong>In Cats:</strong> Hiding for long periods, over-grooming, or changes in litter box habits.</li>
      </ul>
       <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-text-dark mt-8 mb-4">2. How to Help Your Anxious Pet</h2>
      <p>Helping an anxious pet requires patience. Create a safe haven for them, establish a consistent routine for feeding and walks, and provide plenty of physical and mental exercise with toys and puzzles.</p>
